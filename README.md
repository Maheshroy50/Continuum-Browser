# Continuum

> A task-first, privacy-native browser that preserves context and lets you resume exactly where you left off.

**Created by Mahesh Rao**

## ✨ Philosophy

**Resume your work, not your tabs.**

Continuum organizes browsing into **Workspaces** — persistent contexts that remember everything: your scroll position, open pages, notes, and focus. Unlike Chrome where tabs disappear and history is lost, Continuum treats your browsing as continuous work.
